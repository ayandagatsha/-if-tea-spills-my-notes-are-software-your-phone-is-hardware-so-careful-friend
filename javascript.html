        <h3   class="footer" style="padding: 0 100px 0 100px;">Get in touch with me, I'm the owner and would love to turn what you can imagine and dream, into a website that can be powered by the backend I create. And I'll do that job loving it and appreciating the creators of javascript and node in how they allow me to better help people that ask me for my value.  Click: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akmyrightchoice/" target="_blank">to connect on LinkdIn</a> it 
          was great giving you a virtual tour of what I can do in regards to web development. It's amazing
          to think at some point in the past, I wrote the files to deploy 
          that would tell any device with a v8 engine and browser to read my files and give you a virtual 
          tour of my skill set in a way that makes me feel good. I feel good when people going through my website or 
          experiencing the services of whatever i do for my job feel good. When I was a waiter I loved how 
          the customers overtipped me since I made sure they got their meal with chess-level, psychological emotional intelligence strategies to get good user experience feedback. I at subway, got five stars for customer engagement services, it was great. What can I do for you?
