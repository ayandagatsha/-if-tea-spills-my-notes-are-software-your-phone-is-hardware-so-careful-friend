          <h2> Me, using psychology and chess level analysis to succeed at training dogs capable of providing security and companionship for an owner. I'll throw in ensuring the dogs can do something cool as tribute to my web development instructors for their lessons and train them sheep. Just a little something to say, hey guys, you trained me to understand web development so I used that understanding to 
            train them to herd sheep. My fathers' farm was the enviroment object that the dog objects could run my web files, also known as training to non developers. When the files/training are ran through the dogs, brain, cpu like system, they understand that I want them to herd the goats in when I make a hand gesture and record them for my boss that wants the dogs trained.  
            The other job, videography: I can also use chess level strategizing and psychology to use the right, conventional social methods to build a circle of friends that would employ me to be the videographer of a profitable theatre production. I can then use various methods to edit and draft working products for them to advertize to our network through social media. We can track feedback and I can update the edits. I really love the usefulness of version control systems like github and bitbucket. Feels like reality is a game when I commit and push my code, since I played games with auto save my whole. I love working with technology. </h2>
